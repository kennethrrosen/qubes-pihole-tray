# qubes-pihole-tray
 Simple GTK pi-hole tray indicator for QubesOS 

### 17 Jan 2024: THIS IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS.

Currently the only functionality of the script is to show that Pi-hole is running, nothing more. I'm working on getting the right-click status functionality working. Comments and suggestions welcome.

TODO:
- create systemd service
- enable status on hover
- fix right-click menu for enable/disable
- package as rpm
